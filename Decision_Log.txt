DRONE OPERATIONS COORDINATOR AI – DECISION LOG

Key Assumptions
The coordinator primarily performs operational validation rather than autonomous decision making.
Google Sheets serves as a lightweight operations database.
Human supervisors will approve suggested assignments.

Architecture Decision
A hybrid architecture was chosen:
LLM / NLP → Understand user intent
Rule Engine → Perform mission assignment

This ensures deterministic behavior required in operational systems.

Trade-offs
Streamlit instead of React:
Faster prototype delivery and zero setup for evaluators.

Google Sheets instead of SQL:
Meets assignment constraints and enables easy live testing.

Gemini + Rule fallback:
Avoids API failures and guarantees system reliability.

Urgent Reassignment Interpretation
Urgent reassignment is defined as replacing a failed pilot or drone during an active mission.
The system searches for the nearest available compatible resources and provides a continuation plan.

Future Improvements
Weather API integration
Distance-based optimization
Automated scheduling calendar
Push notification alerts
